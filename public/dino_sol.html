    /*      -- species, genus, nickname, descriptive adjective reflective of that dinosaur's personality.
            -- method 'trample' -> which when called, issues an ALERT that says "Watch Out!  <nickname> is on the loose!".  If the dinosaur is a predator, it should say "Rawrrr!  <nickname> is on a rampage!"
            -- an array of favorite foods.
            -- age

        Bitey, a solitary Tyrannosaurus rex is 27 years old.
