    // You've just been hired as a junior web developer at a park.  A park unlike any other.  And in this park, we have a particular kind of attraction - one the world has not seen in some time...

    // Your new boss, Nedry, has tasked you with some JSON related work.

    // Create an object called Dinosaur.  
    var Dinosaur = {
        "genus": ,
        "species": ,
        "nickname": ,
        "age": ,
        "temperment": ,
        "predator": ,
        "foods":
    }

    // This object should have the following properties, with a relevant data types:
    /*      -- species, genus, nickname, descriptive adjective reflective of that dinosaur's personality.
            -- method 'trample' -> which when called, issues an ALERT that says "Watch Out!  <nickname> is on the loose!".  If the dinosaur is a predator, it should say "Rawrrr!  <nickname> is on a rampage!"
            -- predator (boolean), true or false
            -- an array of favorite foods.
            -- age
    */

        alert('Watch Out! ' + Dinosaur["nickname"] + ' is on the loose!');

        }
        else {
            alert('Squeak!');
        }

    }

    // The output should look like this:
    /*

        Dinosaur #:
        <nickname>, a <descriptive adjective> <genus> <species>, is <age> years old.  
        Their favorite foods are: <favorite foods>.
        Then call the trample method for that dinosaur.

    */

    // At the end of this assignment, you should have ATLEAST three dinosaurs.  Try putting them all in an array, and looping through them!

    // Output the dinosaurs in alphabetical order, according to nickname.

    // Remember the keyword: "this".
